# Generative-text-gpt2
📌 About the Project
This project demonstrates the use of a Generative Text Model powered by GPT-2, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. The application is capable of generating coherent, meaningful paragraphs based on user-provided topics or prompts.

By leveraging the power of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library, this project enables intelligent text generation without the need for extensive training or large datasets. It accepts a short input (such as “Benefits of Reading” or “Role of AI in Healthcare”) and outputs a paragraph that is contextually relevant and human-like.
